/// Convenience function for creating in-process connectors.
///
/// Creates a [ButtplugClient] event loop, with an in-process connector with
/// all device managers that ship with the library and work on the current
/// platform added to it already. Takes a maximum ping time to build the
/// server with, other parameters match `run()`.
///
/// # When To Use This Instead of `run()`
///
/// If you just want to build a quick example and save yourself a few use
/// statements and setup, this will get you going. For anything *production*,
/// we recommend using `run()` as you will have more control over what
/// happens. This method may gain/lose device comm managers at any time.
///
/// # The Device I Want To Use Doesn't Show Up
///
/// If you are trying to use this method to create your client, and do not see
/// the devices you want, there are a couple of things to check:
///
/// - Are you on a platform that the device communication manager supports?
///   For instance, we only support XInput on windows.
/// - Did the developers add a new Device CommunicationManager type and forget
///   to add it to this method? _It's more likely than you think!_ [File a
///   bug](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs/issues).
///
/// # Errors
///
/// If the library was compiled without any device managers, the
/// [ButtplugClient] will have nothing to do. This is considered a
/// catastrophic failure and the library will return an error.
///
/// If the library is using outside device managers, it is recommended to
/// build your own connector, add your device manager to those, and use the
/// `run()` method to pass it in.
