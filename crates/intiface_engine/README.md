CLI and Library frontend for Buttplug

Intiface Engine is just a front-end for [Buttplug](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug),
but since we're trying to not make people install a program named "Buttplug", here we are.

While this program can be used standalone, it will mostly be featured as a backend/engine for
Intiface Central.

## Running

Command line options are as follows:

| Option | Description |
| --------- | --------- |
| `version` | Print version and exit |
| `server-version` | Print version and exit (kept for legacy reasons) |
| `websocket-use-all-interfaces` | Websocket servers will listen on all interfaces (versus only on localhost, which is default) |
| `websocket-port [port]` | Network port for connecting via non-ssl (ws://) protocols |
| `frontend-websocket-port` | IPC JSON port for Intiface Central |
| `server-name` | Identifying name server should emit when asked for info |
| `device-config-file [file]` | Device configuration file to load (if omitted, uses internal) |
| `user-device-config-file [file]` | User device configuration file to load (if omitted, none used) |
| `max-ping-time [number]` | Milliseconds for ping time limit of server (if omitted, set to 0) |
| `log` | Level of logs to output by default (if omitted, set to None) |
| `allow-raw` | Allow clients to communicate using raw messages (DANGEROUS, CAN BRICK SOME DEVICES) |
| `use-bluetooth-le` | Use the Bluetooth LE Buttplug Device Communication Manager |
| `use-serial` | Use the Serial Port Buttplug Device Communication Manager |
| `use-hid` | Use the HID Buttplug Device Communication Manager |
| `use-lovense-dongle` | Use the HID Lovense Dongle Buttplug Device Communication Manager |
| `use-xinput` | Use the XInput Buttplug Device Communication Manager |
| `use-lovense-connect` | Use the Lovense Connect Buttplug Device Communication Manager |
| `use-device-websocket-server` | Use the Device Websocket Server Buttplug Device Communication Manager |
| `device-websocket-server-port` | Port for the device websocket server |

For example, to run the server on websockets at port 12345 with bluetooth device support:

`intiface-engine --websocket-port 12345 --use-bluetooth-le`

## Compiling

Linux will have extra compilation dependency requirements via
[buttplug-rs](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs). For pacakges required,
please check there.

## Contributing

Right now, we mostly need code/API style reviews and feedback. We don't really have any good
bite-sized chunks to mentor the implementation yet, but one we do, those will be marked "Help
Wanted" in our [github issues](https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs/issues).

As we need money to keep up with supporting the latest and greatest hardware, we also have multiple
ways to donate!
