## Features

# Intiface Engine v2.0.0 (2024/01/21)

## Breaking Changes

- Removed sentry/crash reporting
  - This is now a library AND a CLI. If someone is using the CLI, they're using it in their own
    setup they can wrap it in whatever crash reporter they want. Moving crash reporting up to Intiface Central.
- Removed logging for library instances
  - Intiface was originally built as a CLI and meant to be run only as such. Now that it's a CLI and
    a library, we need to let applications handle their own logging. The CLI build still has logging features, but library now just exposes a log/tracing interface.
- Removed Websocket Frontend
  - This was used when we were letting other programs run the CLI. Now that there's a library mode,
    we expect applications to just attach directly. This makes things more secure overall, and if users want it back, they can implement their own frontend using the trait.
- All above changes will mostly be reflected externally in either missing CLI arguments, or updates
  to the EngineOptions struct.
- The v2 line may be fairly short, as the engine will once again have a major revision once Buttplug
  moves to its new spec and therefore new major revision.

- Update to Buttplug v7.1.12
  - Massive number of hardware support updates/bugfixes, just go look at the CHANGELOG
