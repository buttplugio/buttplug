This crate contains code necessary for connecting to serial ports on all desktop platforms. Mostly used by OSR-2/SR-6/SSR-1 users for direct "high-speed" connection. Yes, being able to connect over a wire at 115200 baud and get 50hz+ updates is considered high-speed in this field, in the year of our lord 2025. I fucking hate my job sometimes.
