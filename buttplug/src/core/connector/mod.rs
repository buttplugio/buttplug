//! Methods for establishing connections between Buttplug Clients and Servers
//!
//! Buttplug is made to work in many different circumstances. The [crate::client::ButtplugClient]
//! and [crate::server::ButtplugServer] may be in the same process, in different process
//! communicating over some sort of IPC, or on different machines using a network connection.
//! Connectors are what make these setups possible.
//!
//! # How Buttplug Clients and Servers Use Connectors
//!
//! A Buttplug Client uses a connector to communicate with a server, be it in the same process or on
//! another machine. The client's connector handles establishing the connection to the server, as
//! well as sending ([possibly serialized][crate::core::messages::serializer]) messages to the
//! server and matching replies from the server to waiting futures.
//!
//! Buttplug servers use connectors to receive info from clients. They usually have less to do than
//! client connectors, because they don't have to keep track of messages waiting for replies (since
//! Buttplug messages that require responses are only client -> server, the server will never send
//! anything to a client that expects a response.)
//!
//! # In-Process and Remote Connectors
//!
//! There are two types of connectors: In-Process and Remote. All connectors have the same API
//! (since they all follow the [crate::connector::ButtplugConnector] trait), but will varying in
//! latency, message passing techniques, etc...
//!
//! There is only 1 in-process connector, the [ButtplugInProcessClientConnector]. This is used when
//! the client and server live in the same process, which is useful for multiple reasons (see
//! [ButtplugInProcessClientConnector] documentation for more info). As in-process connectors can
//! just send message objects back and forth, there is no need for message serialization.
//!
//! Remote connectors refer to any connector that connects to something outside of the current
//! process, be it still on the same machine (IPC) or somewhere else (network).
//!
//! # Remote Transports
//!
//! Remote Transports
//!
//! # Buttplug Client/Server Does Not Necessarily Mean Transport Client/Server
//!
//! Here's an odd but valid situation: *You can have a Buttplug Client that uses a Websocket Server
//! connector!*
//!
//! There are times where this is actually useful. For instance, let's say a user of Buttplug wants
//! to use a Windows 7 desktop machine to control a Bluetooth LE toy. This normally wouldn't work
//! because Windows 7 doesn't have a Bluetooth LE API we can easily access. However, they also have
//! an android phone. They could run a Buttplug Server in Chrome on their Android phone, have the
//! Client on the desktop run a websocket server, then have (and stick with me here) the Buttplug
//! Server in the Android Chrome instance use a Websocket Client to connect to the Websocket Server
//! on the desktop. This allows the desktop machine to proxy Bluetooth to the WebBluetooth API built
//! into Android Chrome.
//!
//! Is this ridiculous? *Absolutely*.
//!
//! Will people do it? Remember, this is a library about sex, so the answer is also *Absolutely*.
//!
//! There are slightly more useful situations like device forwarders where this work comes in also,
//! but that Windows 7/Android example is where the idea originally came from.
