/// Message sorting and pairing for remote client connectors.
///
/// In order to create reliable connections to remote systems, we need a way to maintain message
/// coherence. We expect that whenever a client sends the server a request message, the server will
/// always send back a response message.
///
/// For the [in-process][crate::connector::ButtplugInProcessClientConnector] case, where the client and
/// server are in the same process, we can simply use execution flow to match the client message and
/// server response. However, when going over IPC or network, we have to wait to hear back from the
/// server. To match the outgoing client request message with the incoming server response message
/// in the remote case, we use the `id` field of [ButtplugMessage]. The client's request message
/// will have a server response with a matching index. Any message that comes from the server
/// without an originating client message ([DeviceAdded][crate::core::messages::DeviceAdded],
/// [Log][crate::core::messages::Log], etc...) will have an `id` of 0 and is considered an *event*,
/// meaning something happened on the server that was not directly tied to a client request.
///
/// The ClientConnectionMessageSorter does two things to facilitate this matching:
///
/// - Creates and keeps track of the current message `id`, as a [u32]
/// - Manages a HashMap of indexes to resolvable futures.
///
/// Whenever a remote connector sends a [ButtplugMessage], it first puts it through its
/// ClientMessageSorter to fill in the message `id`. Similarly, when a [ButtplugMessage] is
/// received, it comes through the sorter, with one of 3 outcomes:
///
/// - If there is a future with matching `id` waiting on a response, it resolves that future using
///   the incoming message
/// - If the message `id` is 0, the message is emitted as an *event*.
/// - If the message `id` is not zero but there is no future waiting, the message is dropped and an
///   error is emitted.
///
pub struct ClientMessageSorter {
  /// Map of message `id`s to their related future.
  ///
  /// This is where we store message `id`s that are waiting for a return from the server. Once we
  /// get back a response with a matching `id`, we remove the entry from this map, and use the waker
  /// to complete the future with the received response message.

  /// increasing counter for setting `id`s.
