    // Ok, somehow this whole function has been basically a no-op. The read/write lines never had an
    // await on them, so they were never run. But only now, in Rust 1.75/Buttplug 7.1.15, have we
    // gotten a complaint from the compiler. Going to comment this out for now and see what happens.
    // If we don't get any complaints, I'm going to have to rewrite all of my snark here. :(

    // Ok, here we go. This is an overly-complex nightmare but apparently "protocomm makes the
    // firmware easier".
    //
    // This code is mostly my translation of the Handy Python POC. It leaves out a lot of stuff
    // that doesn't seem needed (ping messages, the whole RequestServerInfo flow, etc...) If they
    // ever change anything, I quit.
    //
    // If you are a sex toy manufacturer reading this code: Please, talk to me before implementing
    // your protocol. Buttplug is not made to be a hardware/firmware protocol, and you will regret
    // trying to make it such.

    // First we need to set up a session with The Handy. This will require sending the "security
    // initializer" to basically say we're sending plaintext. Due to pb3 making everything
    // optional, we have some Option<T> wrappers here.

    // let session_req = protocomm::SessionData {
    //   sec_ver: protocomm::SecSchemeVersion::SecScheme0 as i32,
    //   proto: Some(protocomm::session_data::Proto::Sec0(
    //     protocomm::Sec0Payload {
    //       msg: protocomm::Sec0MsgType::S0SessionCommand as i32,
    //       payload: Some(protocomm::sec0_payload::Payload::Sc(
    //         protocomm::S0SessionCmd {},
    //       )),
    //     },
    //   )),
    // };

    // We need to shove this at what we're calling the "firmware" endpoint but is actually the
    // "prov-session" characteristic. These names are stored in characteristic descriptors, which
    // isn't super common on sex toys (with exceptions for things that have a lot of sensors, like
    // the Lelo F1s).
    //
    // I don't have to do characteristic descriptor lookups for the other 140+ pieces of hardware
    // this library supports so I'm damn well not doing it now. YOLO'ing hardcoded values from the
    // device config.
    //
    // If they ever change this, I quit (or will just update the device config).

    // hardware.write_value(&HardwareWriteCmd::new(Endpoint::Firmware, sec_buf, false));
    // hardware.read_value(&HardwareReadCmd::new(Endpoint::Firmware, 100, 500));

    // At this point, the "handyplug" protocol does actually have both RequestServerInfo and Ping
    // messages that it can use. However, having removed these and still tried to run the system,
    // it seems fine. I've omitted those for the moment, and will readd the complexity once it
    // does not seem needless.
