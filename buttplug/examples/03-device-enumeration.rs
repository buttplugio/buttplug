  // Time to see what devices are available! In this example, we'll see how
  // servers can access certain types of devices, and how clients can ask
  // servers which devices are available.

  // Since we're going to need to manage our server and client, this example
  // will use an embedded connector.
  // let connector = ButtplugInProcessClientConnector::default();
  // let connector = ButtplugRemoteClientConnector::<ButtplugWebsocketClientTransport, ButtplugClientJSONSerializer>::new(ButtplugWebsocketClientTransport::new_insecure_connector("ws://localhost:12345"));

  // This example will also work with a WebsocketConnector if you want to
  // connect to Intiface Desktop or an intiface-cli instance.

  // We're to the new stuff. When we create a ButtplugEmbeddedConnector, it in
  // turn creates a Buttplug Server to hold (unless we pass it one to use, which
  // we won't be doing until later examples). If you're just interested in
  // creating Buttplug Client applications that will access things like the
  // Windows Buttplug Server, you won't have to set up the server like this, but
  // this is good knowledge to have anyways, so it's recommended to at least
  // read through this.
  //
  // When a Buttplug Server is created, it in turn creates a Device Manager. The
  // Device Manager is basically the hub of all hardware communication for
  // Buttplug. A Device Manager will hold multiple Device Communication
  // Managers, which is where we get to specifics about hardware busses and
  // communications. For instance, as of this writing, Buttplug currently ships
  // with Device Communication Managers for
  //
  // - Bluetooth LE (Windows 10/Mac/Linux/iOS)
  // - XInput/XBox Gamepads (Win >= 7)
  // - Test/Simulator
  //
  // We can specify which device communication managers we want to use. For this
  // example, we'll just add a TestDeviceManager so we don't have to deal with
  // actual hardware. This requires a bit of manual setup.
  //
  // To do this, we'll add the device comm manager. For the test device comm
  // manager, this gets a little complicated. We'll just be emulating a
  // bluetooth device, the Aneros Vivi, by using its bluetooth name.

  /* let helper = connector.server_ref().add_test_comm_manager().unwrap();
   let _ = helper.add_ble_device("Massage Demo").await;
  */
  // If we wanted to add a real device manager, like the btleplug manager,
  // we'd run something like this:
  //
  //connector.server_ref().add_comm_manager::<BtlePlugCommunicationManager>();

  // Anyways, now that we have a manager sorted, Let's talk about when and how
  // you'll get events (in this case, DeviceAdded events) from the server.
  //
  // The server can fire device connection events at 2 points.
  //
  // - When a client first connects, if the server has a device connection it is
  //   already holding.
  //
  // - During device scanning.
  //
  // When the client connects as part of ButtplugClient::run(), it asks the
  // server for a list of already connected devices. The server will return
  // these as DeviceAdded events, including a ButtplugClientDevice instance we
  // can then use to control the device.
  //
  // A quick aside on why a server could hold devices. There are a few reasons
  // this could happen, some chosen, some forced.
  //
  // - On Windows 10, it is sometimes difficult to get bluetooth LE devices to
  //   disconnect, so some software (including the Windows Buttplug Server)
  //   leaves devices connected until either the device is powered off/taken out
  //   of bluetooth range, or the program terminates.
  //
  // - Depending on how a server is being used, parts of it like a device
  //   manager may stay alive between client connections. This would mean that
  //   if a client disconnected from a server then reconnected quickly, setup
  //   steps wouldn't have to happen again.
  //
  // With that out of the way, let's build our client.
  let client = ButtplugClient::new("test client");
  let mut event_stream = client.event_stream();
  client
    .connect_in_process(&ButtplugServerOptions::default())
    .await
    .unwrap();
  // First, we'll start the server looking for devices.
  if let Err(err) = client.start_scanning().await {
    // If the server disconnected between the time we spun up the
    // loop and now, the scanning will return an error. At that
    // point we should just bail out.
    println!("Client errored when starting scan! {}", err);
    return;
  }
  // Ok, we've started scanning. Now we need to wait to hear back from the
  // server on whether we got anything. To do that, we use our event stream.
  //
  // The event stream is to Buttplug's Rust implementation what the event
  // handlers in C#/JS were to those implementations. However, since we're not
  // in a GC'd language anymore, event handlers are a bit difficult to
  // implement, so we just have a stream-like function instead.
  //
  // Running .next() on the event stream will return a future that waits until
  // it gets something from the server. You can either await that and block
  // until you get something from the server (or race/select it against other
  // futures), or else save the future and use something like a timeout join.
  //
  // For our purposes for the moment, all we care about is receiving new
  // devices, so we'll just loop and wait. We'll do so in another task.

          // ButtplugClientDevice object. We could control the
          // device with it if we wanted, but that's coming up
          // in a later example. For now, we'll just print the
          // device name then drop our instance of it.

  // the client. It requires an await as the devices require
