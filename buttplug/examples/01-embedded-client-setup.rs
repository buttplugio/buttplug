// To begin our exploration of the Buttplug library, we're going to set up a client
// with an embedded connector.
//
// To do this, we're going to need to bring in the main Buttplug crate. It's
// literally just called "Buttplug" (https://crates.io/crates/buttplug/). This
// contains all of the base classes for Buttplug core, client, and server.
//
// Unlike other implementation (like JS and C#), where Buttplug required
// multiple packages for different features, the Rust Buttplug crate contains
// everything you need to build Buttplug applications. Aren't Cargo Features
// great?
use buttplug::client::{connectors::ButtplugEmbeddedClientConnector, ButtplugClient, ButtplugClientEvent};

// We're gonna use async_std as our runtime for the examples, but you should be
// able to use futures, tokio, or whatever else.

    // We'll need a connector first, as creating a client requires a connector.
    // Connectors are how clients connect to servers. Since we're just starting
    // out and don't want to deal with networks or IPC yet, we'll create an
    // embedded client. This means that the Connector holds a Buttplug Server
    // itself, so everything happens locally and in-process. This is usually the
    // easiest case to develop with.
    //
    // For now, we'll just give the server a name. We'll go over other server
    // constructor arguments in later examples.
    let mut connector = ButtplugEmbeddedClientConnector::new("Example Server", 0);
    connector.add_comm_manager::<BtlePlugCommunicationManager>();
    // Now that we've got a connector, we can use the ButtplugClient::run()
    // function to spin up our client event loop. We pass this function three
    // things:
    //
    // - The client name, which is sent to the server so we can identify what's
    // connected on that end if the server has a GUI.
    // - The connector we just made, used to connect to the Server
    // - A closure that will run whatever we want to do with Buttplug.
    //
    // The run() function will take our connector, create a client, try to connect
    // that client to the server (which, with an embedded connector, should
    // always succeed), and then will run the closure, passing it the connected
    // client instance.
    //
    // run() will block until we exit our closure. This could happen for
    // multiple reasons, like the client or server disconnecting, or our
    // application signalling that it's done doing whatever it wants to do with
    // buttplug.
    //
    // run() can also return an error in certain situations, like not being able
    // to connect to the server.
    //
    // For sake of clarity and indentation, we'll define our closure first, then
    // pass it into run().
    //
    // Note that the closure is (ButtplugClient) -> impl Future. We'll explain
    // why in the definition.

                // If the server disconnected between the time we spun up the
                // loop and now, the scanning will return an error. At that

            // the server on whether we got anything. To do that, we call
            // wait_for_event.
            //
            // wait_for_event is to Buttplug's Rust implementation what the
            // event handlers in C#/JS were to those implementations. However,
            // since we're not in a GC'd language anymore, event handlers are a
            // bit difficult to implement, so we just have a stream-like
            // function instead.
            //
            // wait_for_event will return a future that waits until it gets
            // something from the server. You can either await that and block
            // until you get something from the server (or race/select it
            // against other futures), or else save the future and use something
            // like a timeout join.
            //
            // For our purposes for the moment, all we care about is receiving

                // - Message Attributes, which can vary depending on the type
                // of message
                //
                // For instance the VibrateCmd message will have a name of
                // "VibrateCmd", and a "FeatureCount" of 1 < x < N, depending on
                // the number of vibration motors the device has. Messages that
                // don't have a FeatureCount will leave Option<FeatureCount> as
                // None.
                //

                // Devices have "generic" commands for vibrate, rotate, and
                // linear (movement). Each of these takes a enum that is either:
                //
                // - A single value to send to all features. For instance if a
                // device has 6 vibrators, and we send one speed, all 6
                // vibrators will be set to that speed.
                //
                // - A map of index/value pairs, which allows setting certain
                // device feature indexes to certain values.
                //
                // - A vector of values, which can address most or all feature
                // indexes.
