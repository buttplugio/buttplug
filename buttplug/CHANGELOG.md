# 9.0.1 (2024-09-02)

## Bugfixes

- #657: Fix issue where message downgrader was not setting message IDs in all cases

# 9.0.0 (2024-09-01)

## Breaking Changes

- The 9.0 line will be our development version for the v4 message spec, which will release in
  Buttplug v10. That said, in order to test the underlying code while v4 is in development, we're
  releasing this as an actual production version. It is assumed that Nonpolynomial is currently the
  only user of the Server portion of the system, which will remain unstable throughout the Buttplug
  v9 version. If anyone else is using the server API, well, I guess we're about to find out.
- The server API now only accepts the latest version of the message spec. As of v9, this is the v4
  message spec, which is currently in development. Therefore, we recommend only using
  ButtplugServerDowngradeWrapper to access a ButtplugServer for the time being. Assuming you're
  accessing the ButtplugServer. Which you probably shouldn't.

## Features

- Rewrite of message version translation system
  - Buttplug server now only communicates in the latest message version, all messages are expected
    to be upgraded before hitting the server, and downgraded after leaving it. This is now handled by the ButtplugServerDowngradeWrapper system.
- Added Device Support
  - Activejoy Vibrating Egg
  - Lovense Mini Sex Machine
  - Many Galaku devices
  - Many Joyhub devices
  - Tryfun Surge Pro

  - Lelo F1S v3

## Bugfixes

- Fix compatibility for early Satisfyer devices

# 8.0.0 (2024-05-12)

## Breaking Changes

- Device Config File Overhaul
  - In order to make life suck less for saving user definitions of devices, I overhauled the device
    config system. This involved removing the internal inheritance chains (which were never used), as well as making some communication definitions and configuration structures more flexible. We lose some of the duplication checking we had enforced by types (though very little if anything would break with duplication present), but gain a shitton of ergonomics. This configuration format will feed forward into the next protocol version, but we'll spend the v8 line making sure it's solid before the Buttplug Message Spec v4 update in the v9 library line.
  - This pushes the device config version to v3 and changes some builder APIs, warrenting a library
    major version bump.

## Features

- Config system sucks less to work with now.
- Added Device Support
  - metaXsire G1
  - JoyHub Mariner, Black Bull, Peacock, Rainbow, Rhythmic 2, Rhythmic 4, MorningBuds

## Breaking(ish) Changes

- ButtplugRemoteServer has been moved up to Intiface Engine, because it mostly deals with handling
  external connections, and was only used by the engine. While this is an API breaking change on the
  server side, I'm pretty sure no one ever used this outside of Intiface Engine, so I'm just making
  this a point release. I guess if someone did use it, I'm gonna hear about it.

# 7.0.0 (2022-12-30)

## Breaking API Change

- In order to accommodate ScalarCmd flexibility, VibrateCommand in the ButtplugClient has been
  changed to ScalarValueCommand. This changes the signature of the vibrate method in the client,
  which may cause breakage.
- Removed IPC connectors. They were never really advertised as usable, and the longer we've stuck
  with websockets, the less feasible breaking out new connectors has become.

## Features

- Added ergonomic action methods to ButtplugClient (ability to query for attributes related to
  scalar actions, etc...)
- Added new_json_ws_client_connector() convenience method for creating new client connectors
- Added Device Support
  - GBalls v3
  - The Cowgirl/The Unicorn
- Removed old, unused rust book
- Moved spec to new docs site repo (https://docs.buttplug.io)

## Bugfixes

- Fixed issue where ButtplugClient could make ill-defined requests for device control. This was done
  by added finalizers to ButtplugMessage, so that DeviceAdded and DeviceList messages can include scalar/sensor indexes in their message attributes. This problem will be fixed at the spec level in spec v4.
- Fix buttplug device config schema issue blocking use of websocket devices.
- Fix Svakom Iker identifiers

  older clients.
- #491: Implement disconnect on Drop for Bluetooth devices

# 6.0.1 (2022-09-24)

## Breaking Changes

- Act like these came in v6, I don't wanna rev to v7 already and afaik no one depends on this
  version of the library yet so y'all just get to deal.
- Device Configuration now uses major/minor semantic versions so we can identify when we can't load
  a device config file.

## Features

- #480: Add Major/Minor versions to device configs.
- Added Hardware Support:
  - Meese Tera
  - Hismith Thrusting Cup
  - Vorze UFO TW
  - Mizz Zee V2 Devices
  - MagicMotion Bobi
  - Satisfyer devices with > 2 vibrators
- Add ability to shutdown a device manager and disconnect all devices explicitly
  - Needed for mobile apps
- Update to btleplug v0.10.1, fixing disconnect on macOS/iOS

## Bugfixes

- #462: Check advertisements to see whether we even have any matching configurations before trying
  to connect to a device.
- #483: Move Lovense Connect Server checking to every 5 seconds, which will hopefully stop rate
  limiting
- #481: Fix issue with device creation tracing span being applied to incorrect tasks
- Correct timing issue in Fredorch protocol
- #479: Make Serial and XInput DCMs less log spammy during scans
  - Serial is backed off to scanning once per 10s, XInput now only loads the XInput library on
    initial construction.

# 6.0.0 (2022-08-29)

## Breaking Changes

- `connector` module moved to `core` instead of top level.
- Renamed `messages` module to `message` (to stay with singular style module naming).
- `device` module now split between `core` (Endpoints struct now in `message` module) and `server`
  (impl, protocols, configs, everything that is server specific now lives there).
- `DeviceImpl` renamed to `Hardware` to clearly signify that it is how we actually communicate with
  hardware (real or virtual).
- `ButtplugDevice` renamed to `ServerDevice`, to denote that it's the representation of the device
  in the server, now clearly separate from `ClientDevice`.
  - Gosh I am really bad at naming things.
- Device configuration file format changed to work with new format of DeviceAdded/DeviceList
  messages. Also removed language specifier for device names, as these were never actually
  used.
- User Device Configuration File format completely overhauled to handle device specifiers (easier
  way to identify unique devices).
- In-process client creation utility method moved to util module.
- Buttplug Server and its components are now constructable via builders, and are immutable after
  construction. This makes management and additions far easier to reason about, and there was no
  reason for mutability there anyways.
- Running StartScanning when a scan is already running no longer throws an error.
- Except in some special cases (WebBluetooth, mostly), device scans will now run until StopScanning
  is sent. Waiting for the ScanningFinished event is no longer recommended on platforms without these special needs.
- GenericCommandManager is now internally mutable, simplifying borrow handling.
- Removed "connected()" status getter from Hardware implementations. We assume that, if a device
  instance is alive, it's connected. Otherwise the device manager will have dropped it. This assumption was made in earlier versions of the library because this was never used, it is now just being made explicit.
- Protocol handlers completely rewritten to minimize amount of code handling. Protocol handlers
  should now handle device identification, initialization, and simple command handling, with all other management (generic command caching, etc) handled in owner structs or traits above the handler itself.
- Replace pub struct members with getset calls.

## Features

- Overhauled device configuration system so it can de/serialize and handle user configuration
  stacking. This is important for being able to load, edit, and save configs from outside the
  library, in applications like Intiface Desktop.
- Simplified the device creation system, making tracing how a device goes from advertisement to
  usable device somewhat clearer (but it's still complicated af).
- Added TimedRetryHardwareCommunicationManager wrapper, for generic retry handling of hot plugging
  in comm managers that don't constantly scan (XInput, USB, etc...).
- Added ScalarCmd message
  - These will replace messages that take a single scalar parameter, specifically VibrateCmd.
    ScalarCmd adds an extra attribute, called _ActuatorType_, that denotes what the scalar commands
    affects when it is sent. For instance, with vibrators the actuator type is _Vibrate_, for
    flywheel fucking machines (hismith, lovense, etc) and some strokers it's _Oscillate_, for the
    Lovense Max air bladder it's _Constrict_, etc... This allows us to add new simple acutation
    types via types of ScalarCmd instead of having to add a new message to the protocol for every
    type.
- Added SensorReadCmd/SensorSubscribeCmd/SensorUnsubscribeCmd/SensorReading messages
  - Allows Buttplug to take input from devices, instead of just sending them commands. Replaces
    BatteryLevelCmd/RSSILevelCmd currently, but also adds the ability to read other sensors like
    buttons, pressure sensors, etc.
- Added Hardware Support
  - KGoal Boost
  - Hismith Fucking Machines
  - XInput Battery Levels
  - Lovense Max Air Bladder (via ScalarCmd Constrict Actuator Type)
- New scriptable test system for end-to-end (virtual) device testing, across v2 and v3 of the
  Buttplug Protocol (v0/v1 coming in a later update).
- Device configurations now specify a step range instead of step count. This allows users to
  customize the range of values a device can take, for instance setting a maximum speed that
  Buttplug will run a device at. Clients are still given Step Count for the number of states
  available for a message. For instance, if a device has a normal range of [0, 10], a client would
  get a step count of 10. However if a device has a range of [0, 5], the client would only see a
  step count of 5. Changing the bottom of the range will allow the user to set a lower bound as well
  as an upper bound, which is useful for linear devices to isolate a stroking range.
- Added `FeatureDescriptor` to device features. This will describe what certain features of devices
  are, relating to their available device commands. For instance, we can denote which Lovense Edge
  vibrator is the insertable vibrator versus which is the perineum vibrator, and that information is
  sent to the client.

## Bugfixes

- Fixed issue with collisions for devices that don't advertise enough information in their
  bluetooth advertisement (namely, Satisfyer and Magic Motion devices).
- Rebuilt Buttplug JSON Schema to handle all message spec versions simultaneously yet clearly
  (versus the vague, underspecified mess it was before).
- Ping timeouts now actually stop devices
- Close the server side of a websocket when the client side closes (this was causing issues with
  websocket tests on macos/linux, we can run those tests now!)

## Breaking Changes

- No breaking Client API changes
- Server API Surface changes
  - In lieu of proxying APIs up thru the server, we now just expose a way to get a reference to a
    device manager for adding protocols, configurations, etc...

# 4.0.4 (2021-07-04)

## Features

- Added Hardware Support
  - Adult Festa Rocket+1D
  - Vorze Piston SA

  - Libo Selina
- #311: Reduce runtime support to simplify library
  - Added tokio runtime support
    - Needed for Unity support of buttplug-rs.
  - Removed async-std runtime support
    - We don't really have the resources to keep supporting multiple runtimes, and async-std has
      tokio compat.
  - Removed futures::ThreadPool runtime support
    - This was easy to support when the library started, but seems silly now.
- #310: Removed Secure Sockets as on option on Websocket Servers
  - Our original reason for implementing this was for browsers that didn't handle connecting to
    mixed content (i.e. https website connecting via websockets to http localhost). Firefox resolved
    this a few months ago, and Chrome and Edge both support it too. Safari has always been a weird
    mess, so we don't really care there. If users still need this functionality, they can set up their own reverse proxy, but this frees us from having to support this for them, which took a ton of code and time.
- Added more logging, now using fields to track device lifetimes across log contexts
- #312: Added more Drop implementations to make clean shutdown happen properly

## Bugfixes

- #295: Prettylove devices require WriteWithResponse to control properly.

## Breaking Changes

- ButtplugWebsocketServerConnectorOptions no longer has secure options, and the insecure port option
  is now mandatory.
- Removed build features for no longer supported runtimes, native programs using Buttplug as an
  executable will need to spin up a tokio runtime, either via the tokio::main macro or manually.

# 2.1.9 (2021-04-04)

## Bugfixes

- Fix compilation issue with btleplug in Linux and on CI
- Fix device enumeration example to use all comm managers by default

# 2.1.0 (2021-02-04)

## Features

- Hardware Support
  - Nobra's Silicone Dreams (All bluetooth 2/RFCOMM controllable toys)
  - Lovense Diamo
- Add message validation 
  - We were only checking messages via the JSON schema, which wasn't handling a lot of invalid
    content. Things should now throw more useful errors on invalid content.
  - Outside of message ids, messages are now immutable, meaning we don't have to check validity
    multiple times. 
- Clean up connector and transport code
  - Fix a lot of weird return types and trait bounds.
- Add more tests, as well as testing capabilities
  - Thanks to the connector/transport cleanup we can now test connectors and serializers easier.
- Consolidate support repos into main repo
  - buttplug-rs now has both device config and schema repos in it.

  - Put the wrong decorator on the field. :(

# 2.0.4 (2021-01-24)

## Bugfixes

- #258: XInput devices no longer cause panic on discovery due to address/identifier mismatches
- #259: Make sure futures-timer works with WASM
  - Also fixes #253 (Onyx+ issues) because I can readd the init delay between packets for WASM

# 2.0.3 (2021-01-21)

## Bugfixes

- #256: Constrain device message types available in clients
  - Clients shouldn't have to deal with deprecated messages, but sometimes the server will send them
    in attributes (See #257). Constraint the available messages to those currently live in the spec.
    Only really affects FFI libraries.

# 2.0.2 (2021-01-18)

## Bugfixes

## Features

- #202, #227, #228, #246: Rebuild the event and channel systems using tokio channels
  - Switched from using async-channel and the broadcaster crate to tokio's sync module, which has a
    far more ergonomic channel system. Greatly reduces chances of leaking channels.
  - Massively changes how the surface API looks, hence rolling major versions.
- Restructed DeviceImpl objects to reduce boilerplate and centralize check logic.
- Restructed internal event loops to be slightly less messy.
- Added device support
  - Lovense Ferri

- #245: Fix device configuration for Virtual Rabbit

# 1.0.4 (2021-01-02)

## Features

- #238: XInput gamepads now fire Disconnection events, which should stop devices from being
  double-added.

# 1.0.3 (2021-01-01)

## Features

- #235: XInput now rescans every 1 second until told to stop (versus scanning once and never
  scanning until StartScanning is called again.)
- #231: Use LTO in release builds

## Bugfixes

- #236: Bluetooth device scanning no longer ignores addresses without names in advertisements. Fixes
  issues where RSSI updates were received before advertisements.
- #234: Fix declaration of Send/Sync on ButtplugFutureSharedState

# 1.0.2 (2020-12-31)

## Bugfixes

- Fix race condition that caused ScanningFinished to be fired before some managers may have finished
  scanning.
- Fix a bunch of intermittent test issues that were plaguing CI.

# 1.0.1 (2020-12-27)

## Bugfixes

- Roll back Valico dependency to 3.4.0. 3.5.0 brings in a ton of extremely old and unmaintained
  libraries, some of which break WASM.

# 1.0.0 (2020-12-27)

## API Changes

- Return futures::Stream instead of futures::StreamExt for event streams
- Add device config file version loading

# 0.11.3 (2020-12-22)

- Client now emits ServerDisconnect when server disconnects.
- Client and Server now emit ScanningFinished when all scanning has stopped.
- Adjust Send trait requirements for async spawned tasks from the WASM manager.
- Remove unused WASM bindings.

# 0.11.1 (2020-11-26)

## API Changes

- Add hardware support
  - Mysteryvibe (all products)
- Implement device disconnect in buttplug-rs client
- Implement manual ping in buttplug-rs client

## Bugfixes

- Remove Default trait implementations for device messages
  - They always need device IDs and shouldn't be default constructable.
  - Fixes StopDeviceCmd issues in buttplug-rs client

# 0.11.0 (2020-10-31)

## API Changes

- ButtplugClientDevice now sent with ButtplugClientEvent::DeviceRemoved event
  - Used to just send the index, but that's annoying for the user.
- More WASM type exposure.

# 0.10.1 (2020-10-24)

## Bugfixes

- Devices now keep their indexes for the life of the process, based on device
  address.
- Fixed a lot of Lovense Dongle bugs
  - Devices now register disconnects
  - Dongle now emits scanning finished events
  - Dongle now handles being unplugged (but not replugged yet)
- Removed .unwrap()s in BTLEPlug that were causing crashes.

  - Must be explicitly turned on during server creation
  - Devices will have "(Raw)" appended to their display names to let users know
    raw commands are active.
- Added 32 generic endpoints
  - Needed for Raw message setup
- Added stop_all_devices to client API

## Bugfixes

- Websocket Server no longer panics on bogus connect (TLS on non-TLS port, vice
  versa, browser hasn't accepted cert, etc...)
- Server now stops scanning when a client disconnects

## API Changes

- Removed RequestLog/Log access in API, as those messages were deprecated in v2
  of the message spec.
  - Older apps will just receive an error when RequestLog is sent.
- Creating a server now takes a Server Options struct argument.
  - All methods of creating servers (directly, ButtplugRemoteServer, servers in
    InProcessConnectors) have been updated to this format.
- DeviceConfigurationManager no longer static
  - Makes it easier to configure for Raw Messages, and is also just a better
    architecture in general.
- Fallible/non-Self-returning new() methods no longer called new()
  - Idiomatic rust requires infallible new() -> Self, and a lot of our
    constructors are fallible and sometimes return tuples.
- Removed ButtplugProtocolCreator
  - Was needed when we were using async_trait due to associated trait methods,
    now just bound on Self: Sized.

# 0.9.2 (2020-10-06)

## Bugfixes

- Update to btleplug 0.5.4, fixing a bug with trying to read from bluetooth
  devices on macOS.

# 0.9.1 (2020-10-05)

## Bugfixes

- Update to btleplug 0.5.3, fixing a bug with trying to write to bluetooth
  devices on macOS.

# 0.9.0 (2020-10-04)

## Features

- Implements BatteryLevelCmd/BatteryLevelReading
  - Can read battery values from Lovense and some MagicMotion devices.

## Bugfixes

- Devices now only pay attention to their events, not all events ever.
  - Devices were mistaking other devices disconnecting for their own
    disconnection, causing tons of issues in 2+ device situations.

# 0.8.4 (2020-10-01)

## Features

- Added more Lovense UUIDs
  - Should work with Ambi now? Maybe?
  - Might work with Lovense Mission

## Features

- Simplified logging, adding a channel output filter while removing
  request_log/log client access for the moment.
  - Minor version update due to public facing API surface change.
  - Not particularly sure about the future of logging in the Buttplug Protocol,
    as it's both a security risk and difficult to work with. It seems like it
    might be better to expunge logging from the protocol and just deal with it
    at the library/app level. See
    https://github.com/buttplugio/buttplug-rs/issues/131 for more discussion.

## Bugfixes

- Lovense rotation for Nora works again
- Websocket Server should stop panicing on unwrap when connection is not severed
  gracefully (#153)

# 0.7.3 (2020-09-11)

- Allow for loading either PKCS8 or RSA private keys in websocket secure server
  impl

# 0.7.2 (2020-09-07)

## Features

- Websockets now actually listen on all interfaces when option is passed.

# 0.7.1 (2020-09-06)

## Bugfixes

- Fix documentation location so docs.rs doesn't get mad about missing docs.

# 0.7.0 (2020-09-06)

## Features

- Added device support:
  - Kiiroo v2 (Onyx 2/Launch), v2.1 (Onyx+/Cliona/Titan/Blowbot/Pearl 2/Pearl 2.1 etc)
  - Vibratissimo (all products)
  - Motorbunny
  - WeVibe
  - Magic Motion
- Expose device index on client devices for FFI usage
- Have remote server emit events for Intiface CLI

## Bugfixes

- Fix LinearCmd JSON schema
- Fix mismatched stepcounts for some devices in device config
- Make device command rounding use ceiling, mirroring output of
  buttplug-js/buttplug-csharp

# 0.6.0 (2020-08-03)

## Features

- Add websocket server transport, allowing a buttplug client/server to sit
  behind either a websocket client or server.
- Add Remote Server class, allowing a buttplug server to be wrapped in a
  serializer and transport for remote use (i.e. over websockets, tcp, etc), as
  well as being reused between connections.

## Bugfixes

- Fix names of Lovense Dongle managers so they don't write over each other.
- Fix checking of comm managers being added so two managers of the same
  name/type can't be added.
- Lovense HID Dongle manager no longer panics if it can't find a dongle.
- Import README as top level doc
- Fix library building with feature variations (i.e. no features, client only,
  server only, etc)

## Maintenance

- Change feature names to all be kebab-case, and to follow certain standards
  (i.e. all comm manager features end in "-manager")

# 0.5.0 (2020-07-26)

## Features

- Error system now uses thiserror
  - Should be more consistent and provide more useful errors. I hope. Maybe.
- Serial port support added
  - No protocols using this yet, TCode/ET312/etc coming in point releases.
- Lovense dongle support added
  - Handles both serial and HID versions of the dongle, on all desktop
    platforms.

## Bugfixes

- Bluetooth Device Disconnections now notify on all native platforms
  - Used to be just linux, now fixed for mac/win also
- Stopping scanning twice no longer panics
- Fix start scanning timing to happen when future is await'd
  - This could cause discovery race conditions in the past

# 0.4.0 (2020-06-21)

## Features

- Logging now handled via tracing.
  - More work needed to get all futures instrumented and what not, but we're on
    the way.
- Connector module created, ungluing connectors from the Client API and making
  them Client/Server agnostic. Wrappers from 0.3.0 merged into the connector
  implementation.
  - Server connectors on the way in an upcoming version.
- Abstract serializers into connector module
  - Serializers were split cross Client and Server implementations. Like
    connectors, they are now agnostic to Client/Server usage.
- Abstract runtime management to async_manager
  - Idea taken from https://github.com/najamelan/async_executors, but had some
    different requirements. May switch to that at some point though.
- Add more documentation for Client and Connector modules
- Simplify event loops some
  - The internal event loops were becoming a rats nest of channels, select!'s
    and match blocks. They're still not great, but they're better than they
    were.
- Move to dashmap for internal concurrent Hashmaps
  - Tried evmap, but don't need multi-valued maps. Dashmap is a good
    intermediary between evmap and Arc<Mutex<Hashmap<T>>>
- Implement RawRead/Write/Subscribe/Unsubscribe
  - More Buttplug v2 message spec messages. Still not currently exposed on
    devices as we need it to be an opt-in feature.

## Bugfixes

- Clarify names of messages structs
  - ButtplugIn/OutMessage, while hilariously on-brand for the project, didn't
    provide enough context in code. Renamed to ButtplugClient/ServerMessage,
    which denotes the originating source of the message (since Clients and
    Servers will never send the same message types).
- Async functions now actually async.
  - In earlier versions, most async methods took &mut self, meaning we were not
    async since usage of a struct would be locked while the future executed. As
    of 0.4.0, most if not all exposed methods take &self and return a future,
    meaning the library mostly works through lazy execution now.
- Protocols are no longer opaque macro structures
  - Went a little overboard on macros with protocols, meaning it was extremely
    difficult to tell what code was being generated, and it made debugging a
    nightmare. Protocols are now just structs with certain derivable traits with
    default impls, meaning functionality can be implemented in overrides which
    keeps the code clean and mostly free of boilerplate.
- Fixed race condition bug on device creation
  - We fired connection events before storing off the device, meaning depending
    on task scheduling clients could access devices they just got in DeviceAdded
    messages, that would then report as not found.

# 0.3.1 (2020-05-13)

## Bugfixes

- Error instead of panic on btleplug connection failure
- Explain issues with scanning failures in error message

# 0.3.0 (2020-05-10)

## Features

- Servers can now be extracted from wrappers, meaning they can be
  saved and reused between connections. This allows us to implement
  the --stayopen argument in intiface-cli.
  
## Bugfixes

- Make tests broken in 0.2.4 actually pass again.

# 0.2.4 (2020-05-09)

## Bugfixes

- Fixed issue with ServerInfo not returning proper matching message ID
  when communicating with clients of older spec versions
- Fixed issue with in-process server wrappers not setting message ID
  on return

# 0.2.3 (2020-04-18)

## Features

- ButtplugServerJSONWrapper can now use injected servers instead of always
  creating the server itself

## Bugfixes

- Fix global device config string types
- Update to btleplug 0.4.2, which no longer prints to console on windows
- XInput no longer prints everything to console

# 0.2.2 (2020-04-15)

## Features

- XInput is now a default feature
  - This needed to happen in order to make things like intiface-cli
    easier to build. Doesn't affect any non-windows platforms, as
    everything if cfg'd out.

# 0.2.1 (2020-04-14)

## Bugfixes

- Update the README. Really. That's it. I just forgot. :(

# 0.2.0 (2020-04-12)

## Features

- Added XInput support on windows
- Added TestDeviceCommunicationManager and devices for testing/examples.
- Add RequestLog/Log handling in server.
- Create Server Wrappers concept, for handling message conversion into/out of
  the server. Includes JSON implementation.
- Make Server backward compatible to connections from all older message spec
  versions (using server wrappers), along with ability to do message
  up/downgrades (i.e. VibrateCmd <-> SingleMotorVibrateCmd for spec 0/1)
- Add JSON schema verification of device config files and incoming messages on
  client/server
- Add simple user configuration loading, so users can specify serial ports once
  we support them

## Bugfixes

- Ping timeouts now actually stop devices

## Other

- Divided out message classes into their own files
- Broke ButtplugMessageUnion into smaller message unions, so we can do less type
  checking manually.

# 0.1.0 (2020-02-15)

## Features

- Added server, with Win/Linux/macOS/iOS access to Bluetooth
- Added device support for the following brands:
  - Lovense
  - Picobong
  - Aneros
  - Lovehoney
  - MaxPro
  - PrettyLove
  - Realov
  - Svakom
  - Vorze
  - YouCups
  - Youou
- Server not yet feature complete, missing functionality present in
  C#/Typescript servers. This is an intermediate release to allow
  testing of the server code while work on features and parity with
  other versions continues.

# v0.0.2 - 2019/11/21

## Features

- Overhauled API, now have an event loop that the client is created in
  and lives in.
- Finished full implementation of Client.
- Added features for partial library builds.
- Integrated websocket connector into library.
- More documentation.

# v0.0.2-beta.1 - 2019/11/03

## Features

- Lots of documentation.
- Continue cleaning up experimental implementation.
- Readd server tests.

## Bugfixes

- Connector failure now fails all the way up through the client
  instance.

# v0.0.2-beta.0 - 2019/11/02

## Features

- First version of the new rust rewrite. Uses async/await and Rust
  1.39 heavily.
- Partial client implementation.

# v0.0.1 - 2019/04/18

## Features

- Squatting the name on crates.io because I am horrible.

# v0.0.0 - 2016/10/01

- The original try at building Buttplug in Rust. At the time, tokio
  had just come out, and futures were just becoming a thing. A
  combination of those problems combined with lack of Bluetooth access
  support (which wouldn't even be possible on Windows 10 until April
  2017) meant this version fizzled out pretty quick.
