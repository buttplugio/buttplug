[This file](buttplug-device-config.yml) contains information to bind
protocols to device identifiers for Buttplug libraries. This means
that we can take a set of connection information for something like a
Bluetooth LE device and say "if we see this, we should try to talk to
it in this certain way".

This file is mostly useful for implementation of Buttplug
reference libraries, and is not part of the official Buttplug
Protocol.
